  "Roasted Turkey": {
    "ingredients": [
      "1 12-20 pound turkey",
      "1 onion , peeled and quartered",
      "1 lemon , quartered",
      "1 apple (your favorite kind), quartered",
      ".75 ounce container fresh rosemary ",
      ".75 ounce container fresh thyme ",
      ".75 ounce container fresh sage ",
      "1 cup unsalted butter , softened",
      "1 teaspoon salt",
      "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper",
      "6-8 cloves garlic , minced",
      "fresh chopped herbs",
    ],
    "instructions":
        "If the turkey is frozen: Thaw in the fridge, 24 hours for every 5 pounds of Turkey. I like to give myself 1 extra day, just to be safe. Remove the thawed turkey from the fridge 1 hour before roasting, to let it come to room temperature. Adjust your oven rack so the turkey will sit in the center of the oven. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Make the herb butter by combining room temperature butter, minced garlic, salt, pepper, one tablespoon fresh chopped rosemary, one tablespoon fresh chopped thyme, and half a tablespoon of fresh chopped sage. (You’ll use the remaining fresh herbs for stuffing inside the cavity of the turkey) Remove turkey from packaging and remove the neck and giblets from the inside the cavities of the bird. (Reserve them for gravy, if you want, or discard them). Pat the turkey very dry with paper towels. Season the cavity of the turkey with salt and pepper. Stuff it with the quartered lemon, onion and apple and leftover herbs. Use your fingers to loosen and lift the skin above the breasts (on the top of the turkey) and smooth a few tablespoons of the herb butter underneath. Tuck the wings of the turkey underneath the turkey and set the turkey on a roasting rack inside a roasting pan*. Microwave the remaining herb butter mixture for 30 seconds (it doesn’t need to be completely melted--just really softened). Use a basting brush to brush the remaining herb butter all over the outside of the turkey, legs and wings. Roast at 325 degrees F for about 13-15 minutes per pound, or until internal temperature (inserted on middle of thigh and breast) reaches about 165 degrees.  (I remove the turkey from the oven once it reaches 160 degrees. Then, I tent it with foil, and let it rest on the counter. It will continue cooking under the foil, to reach 165 degrees F.) ***Check the turkey about halfway through cooking, and once the skin gets golden brown, cover the top of the turkey with tinfoil, to protect the breast meat from overcooking. Alternately, you could start cooking the turkey with it tented in foil, then during the last hour or so of cooking you can take the foil off to let the turkey brown. Allow turkey to rest for 20-30 minutes before carving. https://tastesbetterfromscratch.com/how-to-carve-a-turkey/ Reserve any drippings and juice remaining in your roasting pan to make turkey gravy."

Rub exterior of the turkey with vegetable oil and loosely cover with aluminum foil. Roast turkey in the preheated oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the thigh reaches 180 degrees F (85 degrees C) and the interior of the stuffing reaches 165 degrees F (70 degrees C), about 3 1/2 to 4 hours.

  "Cranberry Turkey": {

    "instructions":
        "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Pat the turkey dry and tuck in the wings. Rub the turkey inside and out with 2 tablespoons salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Stuff the cavity with 5 sprigs each of the rosemary and thyme. Tie the legs together and place the turkey breast-up in a roasting pan with a rack. Let sit at room temperature for 1 hour. Heat a saucepan over medium heat and add 4 tablespoons of the butter. Stir in the onion, garlic and the remaining 3 sprigs each rosemary and thyme. Cook until the onions are softened, 6 minutes. Add the cranberries, sugar, vinegar, chipotles, orange zest and juice and 1 teaspoon salt. Simmer until the cranberries start to burst, 8 minutes. Strain. Reserve half for serving. Heat the remaining 6 tablespoons butter in a microwave-safe bowl in the microwave in 30-second increments until melted. Brush the melted butter all over the turkey. Pour 1 cup of the broth into the roasting pan. Roast for 2 hours, basting with the drippings every 30 minutes after the first hour. Add more broth if the pan looks dry. After 2 hours of roasting, brush the turkey with the cranberry-orange glaze every 20 minutes until a thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the thigh reaches 165 degrees F, about 1 hour more, tenting with foil when the turkey reaches the desired darkness. Transfer the turkey to a carving board and let rest 30 minutes before carving. Serve with the reserved glaze."

  "Berry Pie": {
    "ingredients": [
      "2 cups all-purpose flour",
      "½ teaspoon salt",
      "2/3 cup shortening, chilled",
      "6 tablespoons cold water",
      "½ cup white sugar",
      "3 tablespoons cornstarch",
      "2 cups fresh raspberries",
      "1 ½ cups fresh blueberries",
      "1 cup fresh strawberries, halved",
    ],
    "instructions":
        "Make the crust: Combine flour and salt in a large bowl. Cut in cold shortening with 2 knives or a pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing with a fork, until flour mixture is moistened. Do not add more water than you need: when you squeeze a handful of the moistened pastry mixture, it should form a ball. Divide the dough in half and shape into balls. Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Transfer one dough ball to a lightly floured surface. Roll dough from the center to the edges to form a 12-inch circle. Wrap crust around the rolling pin. Unroll it onto a 9-inch pie plate. Ease crust into the pie plate, being careful not to stretch it. Trim the bottom crust evenly with the rim of the pie plate, and return the pastry-lined pie plate to the refrigerator. Make the filling: Mix sugar and cornstarch together in a large bowl. Add raspberries, blueberries, and strawberries; gently toss to coat. Allow fruit mixture to stand for about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place a baking sheet in the oven to preheat. Roll out remaining dough for top crust. Stir berry mixture and pour into the pastry-lined pie plate. Place top crust over filling and trim the edges, leaving a 1/2-inch overhang. Fold top crust under bottom crust, pressing lightly to seal. Crimp the edges and cut vents in the top to allow steam to escape. To prevent over-browning, cover the edges with foil. Bake in the preheated oven on the baking tray for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and continue to bake until crust is golden and filling is bubbling, about 20 minutes more."
